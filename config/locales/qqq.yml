  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_licenses: "{{doc-important|The \"{{!}}\" character and \"all\" should not be translated. \"all\" is an API command.}}"
  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_spm_info_item_subject_names: The 'all' should not be translated, it is a command used in the API.
  actions: "{{Identical|Action}}"
  active_colon: "{{Identical|Active}}"
  admin_content_page_edit_tip: A "named route" is a a rails-specific term which means that in order for a URL like "eol.org/some_route" to work, "some_route" needs to be defined in one of the hard-coded config files.
  all_pages: "{{Identical|All pages}}"
  bi_monthly: The meaning here is "twice every month".
  biodiversity_heritage_library: This is the name of a project and should not be translated. See [[w:Biodiversity Heritage Library|Biodiversity Heritage Library]]
  by: This is meant for use in headers, to proceed the name of a community to indicate ownership of a collection.
  by_scientific_name_table_header: This is a table header which sometimes appears immediately after a separate table header that reads "Search".  It is meant to indicate a second column where a link will be provided to search by the scientific name of the taxon (rather than the common name or some synonym).
  cancel: "{{Identical|Cancel}}"
  cannot_be_associated_with_both_a_user_and_a_community: this is an error message which will almost never appear, wherein a collection was associated with both a user and community. This is wrong because a collection can only be created by one or the other.
  cannot_index_collection_item_type_error: Yes, there is a problem here with the gender/etc of the 'type' argument.  But this is a RARE error (it should really never show up, since it means some new kind of object was introduced to the code) and thus we don't really mind if the error here isn't perfect.
  collections: "{{Identical|Collection}}"
  content_summary_table_count_column_header: "{{Identical|Count}}"
  create_community: This is a button label and is not meant to be (fully) grammatical.
  donate: "{{Identical|Donate}}"
  filter_button: Button text
  help: "{{Identical|Help}}"
  helpers:
    submit:
      user:
        curation_application: "\"Apply\" as in \"apply for a curator job\"."
  home: "{{Identical|Home}}"
  license: "{{Identical|License}}"
  location: "{{Identical|Location}}"
  max_collection_items_error: This wil never, ever be a small number... always at least 500.
  never: This is in regards to the frequency at which the user will receive email. Thus, this case, it means "never, ever".
  on_time_col_header: This is meant as a header for a time column.
  or_copy_them_to_existing_collection: This is intentionally a sentence fragment, as it is much lower on the page...  as a separate header that matches an earlier one.
  or_move_them_to_existing_collection: This is intentionally a sentence fragment, as it is much lower on the page...  as a separate header that matches an earlier one.
  overview: "{{Identical|Overview}}"
  profile: "{{Identical|Profile}}"
  punctuation_comma: This is the symbol used to join lists. (A comma in English.)
  rank_recognized_by_agent: "This resolves in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System:\".  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  rank_recognized_by_agent_colon: "This resolves to something similar to this: \"Taxon recognized by IUCN:\", and acts as the header to a navigatable tree of life, showing the relationships between various levels of taxa."
  rank_recognized_by_from_source: "This can resolve in a format similar to this: \"Species recognized by Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life:\".  where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"agent\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  recognized_by_as_a_rank: "This resolves in a format like this: \"Integrated Taxonomic Information System as a Taxon\".  In the latter case, this entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\". These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  recognized_by_from_source_as_a_rank: "This entry would be seen as a paragraph under a header named \"Recognized by\".  These can get more complex, as occasionally the values are created with Rails' #to_sentence method.  Thus, you can end up with \"The Integrated Taxonomic Information System and T Orrell (custodian) in Catalogue of Life as a Taxon\", where the \"and\" was inserted between two values for the \"recognized_by\" variable.  These do not need to read with prefect grammar, as they are meant to be citations and not flowing speech."
  see_all_collections_with_count_html: This will ALWAYS have more than 1 for the count.
  see_all_communities_with_count_html: This will ALWAYS have more than 1 for the count.
  spm_category_objects_count: SPM = Species Profile Model
  spm_category_partner_count: SPM = Species Profile Model
  taxon_suggested: This is a column header indicating that the values in the column are the taxon names suggested as results for a search term (which is specified in another column).  So, for example, a search term of 'fox' might have 'Vulpes vulpes' as a value in this column.
  toc: TOC =  table of contents
  wants_colon: This is a column header indicating the level of curation ability that a user wants ('full' and 'master' are the possible values in the table.  This does not need to be incredibly clear--it is only seen by admins. Please keep it as short as possible.
  what_is_this_question: "{{Identical|What is this}}"
  never: "This is in regards to the frequency at which the user will receive email.  Thus, this case, it means 'never, ever', not 'never been'."
  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_licenses: "The 'all' should not be translated, it is a command used in the API."
  a_pipe_delimited_list_of_spm_info_item_subject_names: "The 'all' should not be translated, it is a command used in the API."
  faker:
    lorem:
      words: No need to translate this set of words, obviously.
  replying_to_x: "This is for use by JavaScript, and thus the 'X' is replaced AT RUNTIME, and so the character 'X' (literally--do not use your language's version of 'X', but exactly that character: 'X') must appear in your translation. The result will be something like 'Replying to Jeremy' after replacement."
  results_avg: "these are table column headings, and the \'avg\' is meant to represent \'average\', because we're counting the number of results that occurred, on average, for a search term within a given date range."
  suggested_results_avg: "these are table column headings, and the \'avg\' is meant to represent \'average\', because we're counting the number of suggested results that occurred, on average, for a search term within a given date range."
  common_name_avg: "these are table column headings, and the \'avg\' is meant to represent \'average\', because we're counting the number of common name results that occurred, on average, for a search term within a given date range."
  scientific_name_avg: "these are table column headings, and the \'avg\' is meant to represent \'average\', because we're counting the number of scientific name results that occurred, on average, for a search term within a given date range."
  activerecord:
    attributes:
      resource:
        harvest_events: "A 'Harvest Event' is the record of when data was imported for a resource (which is a collection of species information), so the term is meant to capture the sense of data being 'harvested' in a single 'event' in time."
  user_response: "This is a table column heading where the cells in the column represent the response provided by a user when answering a survey question."
  who_registered_before: "The value of this key is simply 'to' because it is used in the context of a date range, where the user inputs a start date before this string and an end date after it.  ie: '...a user who registered from ____ to ____'"
  add_a_taxon_association_label: "A 'taxon association' is the association between a data object (for example, an image) and a single species (or other single taxonomic entity, such as class, order, or kingdom) ... more simply, a taxon association is saying something like 'This is a picture of a blackbird.'"
  comments_on: "This is meant to be the header for a page where we're listing all of the comments on a particular subject, such as 'Comments on An Image of A Blackbird' or 'Comments on Procyon Lotor' or 'Comments on Jeremy Rice'.  Thus, this string is prepended to the title of the page where the comments were originally left, and these titles are supplied by content partners, so we CANNOT know the number, gender, or other information about the string."

We have made two changes to the species page.  The first change was to set the default mode from 'showing authoritative information' to 'showing all information'.  You will still see yellow backgrounds behind content that has not been curated.  The second change was to remove the slider that allowed you to change the setting from all to authoritative.  You can still change that setting by visiting
= link_to 'your preferences', settings_url
and your choice is always shown on the top right part of the species page.

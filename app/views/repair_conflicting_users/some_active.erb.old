Dear <%= @name.strip! ; "#{@name[0..0].capitalize}#{@name[1..-1]}" %>, 

Thank you for your interest and participation in the Encyclopedia of Life (www.eol.org). As EOL grows, our support team is
working to ensure you have the best user experience possible. 

We have recently identified an issue that we'd like to bring to your attention. After reviewing our registration lists, our
records indicate that your username is linked to several Encyclopedia of Life accounts only one of which is active. This may
have occurred because you registered a number of times and then activated one or more accounts separately. 

In order to make sure that each account is associated with a unique username, we will delete the inactive accounts associated
with your username. 

But don't worry - your primary account is still active with EOL. The only difference is that you may need to update your
password and your preferences if the various accounts linked to your email had different passwords and preferences. You can
reset your password if needed by going to https://eol.org/account/forgot_password or by clicking 'Forgot password?' on the
EOL login page. You can edit your settings anytime by logging in and clicking on the "Your Preferences" link. 

We hope you will continue to use EOL and all it has to offer. 

Thanks for your time, 

The EOL Team

Dear <%= @name.strip! ; "#{@name[0..0].capitalize}#{@name[1..-1]}" %>, 

Thank you for your interest and participation in the Encyclopedia of Life (www.eol.org). As EOL grows, our support team is
working to ensure you have the best user experience possible. 

We have recently identified an issue that we'd like to bring to your attention. After reviewing our registration lists, our
records indicate that your Encyclopedia of Life username is a duplicate of another user's. 

To avoid confusion, we have added a unique number to the end of your current username. Your new username is: <%= @new_username
%>. The next time you log into eol.org, please use this updated username. 

If you would like to change your username to something different, you can always do this by logging into your account with
your updated username, editing your username information under the "Account Settings" heading and then clicking the "Update
Account" button at the bottom of the page. 

We hope you will continue to use EOL and all it has to offer. 

Thanks for your time, 

The EOL Team

Dear <%= @name.strip! ; "#{@name[0..0].capitalize}#{@name[1..-1]}" %>, 

Thank you for your interest and participation in the Encyclopedia of Life (www.eol.org). As EOL grows, our support team is
working to ensure you have the best user experience possible. 

We have recently identified an issue that we'd like to bring to your attention. After reviewing our registration lists, our
records indicate that your Encyclopedia of Life username is linked to several EOL accounts that are all inactive. This means
that when you registered at the eol.org site and received the confirmation email you may not have clicked the link to
validate your account or you may have encountered a problem when you clicked the link. 

To remedy this, we will close these inactive accounts and we ask that you visit eol.org to create a new account. When you
receive the confirmation email, please click the link to validate your account. 

We hope you will continue to use EOL and all it has to offer. 

Thanks for your time, 

The EOL Team

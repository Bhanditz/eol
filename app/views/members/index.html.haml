-# TODO - this is duplicated with communities/show.  Really, though, this is mainly used for testing... hmmn:
- i_am_in_this_community = current_user.member_of?(@community)
- member_function = i_am_in_this_community ? 'member allowed' : 'member not_allowed'
- non_member_function = i_am_in_this_community ? 'non_member not_allowed' : 'non_member allowed'
= render :partial => 'index', :locals => {:i_am_in_this_community => i_am_in_this_community, :member_function => member_function, :non_member_function => non_member_function }

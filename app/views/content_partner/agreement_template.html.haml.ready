      Introduction
    %p
      The Encyclopedia of Life and
      = agent.project_name
      agree to work together to develop and share critical biodiversity content to aid in assembling the Encyclopedia of Life.  The Encyclopedia of Life will have access to data objects provided by
      = agent.project_name
      and
      = agent.project_name
      will have access to the resources of the Encyclopedia of Life, including species pages, scanned literature, and informatics tools in accordance with the terms listed below.
    
    %h2
      The Parties
    %p
      The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) is an informal consortium of organizations dedicated to building an on-line Encyclopedia of Life composed of content-rich multi-media species pages for all of the presently known species on Earth. The cornerstone institutions of the EOL are listed at
      %a{ :href => "http://www.eol.org/content/page/institutional_partners", :target => "_blank" }
        http://www.eol.org/content/page/institutional_partners
      \.  Currently, the EOL is composed of five working groups:
    %ul
      %li
        %em
          Species Pages Group
        \- defines the composition of information on species pages; works with the scientific community to identify potential sources of information (such as the Content Partner) for the species pages and to authenticate the information on the species pages; establishes licensing agreements with data providers.
      %li
        %em
          Biodiversity Informatics Group
        \- conceptualizes and prepares the software needed to host and to search the species pages; applies taxonomic intelligence to the scientific names on the species pages and in the literature.
      %li
        %em
          Scanning and Digitization Group
        \- working with the Biodiversity Heritage Library, a consortium of many of the world's largest natural history libraries, digitizes and marks up the world's biodiversity literature.
      %li
        %em
          Education and Outreach Group
        \- exploits the EOL's potential by exploring and promoting its educational uses.
      %li
        %em
          Biodiversity Synthesis Group
        \- holds synthesis meetings to help reach taxonomic consensus on megadiverse groups; develops tools for analyzing and synthesizing information across species pages.

      Content Licensing
    %p
      To the greatest extent possible, the Encyclopedia of Life promotes an open-source, open-access approach. Therefore, it requires that content providers (including the EOL's core participants) serving information through the EOL agree to the following provisions:
    %ol
      %li
        Content providers warrant and represent that the content they provide under this Agreement either is in the public domain, that they hold the rights, or that they have obtained the necessary permissions from the rights-holders to use, reproduce and disseminate the content for use in the Encyclopedia, and that the content providers will hold EOL and the members of the EOL consortium harmless in the event of a claim arising from the submitted content.
      %li
        All information currently in the public domain will remain in the public domain. Neither the EOL nor the content providers will seek to assert any IPR over any public domain materials that are made available through the EOL.
      %li
        Content providers are required to adopt a Creative Commons license for the information subject to copyright that they serve through the EOL. The default and preferred license is CC-BY (Attribution), which allows users to copy, transmit and reuse the information, and to remix or adapt the information, as long as attribution regarding the source of the information is maintained.
      %li
        Content providers who request some restrictions on re-use of their information may select an alternate Creative Commons license:  CC-BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike), CC-BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial) or CC-BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike).
      %li
        The EOL will provide attribution information for all content that it serves. EOL will also indicate the Creative Commons license attached to each object (text, structured data, graphics, multimedia, etc.).
    %p
      Full information about the Creative Commons licensing can be found at
      %a{ :href => "http://www.creativecommons.org", :target => "_blank" }
        http://www.creativecommons.org
        
    %h2
      Content Attribution
    %p
      EOL intends to provide attribution for all provided content in the manner specified by
      = agent.project_name
      \.  The methodology EOL uses to attribute the content provided by
      = agent.project_name
      is fundamentally based on multi-level text strings and/or logos at the level of individual data objects.
      = agent.project_name
      will submit attribution information via the Transfer Schema.  Note:  The specific style and techniques employed for display of attribution for data objects may change as the EOL evolves.
        
    %h2

    Welcome:  This site allows people and projects who want their information to be shown on EOL species pages to register with us.   This process is designed for partners with structured data (data in databases).  We will gather some information,  create a license agreement, and  confirm  that your data are configured so that they can be easily acquired by EOL.  You must be authorized to make a licensing agreement, and you must have made agreements with the individuals who have contributed information to you.

Greetings, <%= @user.full_name %>.

You have some notifications arriving because you asked for them to be delievered "immediately".  We're currently working on
this code, so this isn't terribly helpful, but at least you can get some idea of how often you'll get email.  Heh.

<% @notes.each do |note| %>
  <% if note.respond_to?(:body) %>
    You got a comment from <%= note.user.full_name %>:

    <%= note.body %>
  <% else %>
    You got something else.  It was a <%= note.class.name %>, but I can't handle those yet.
  <% end %>

<% end %>
Thanks.  Have fun.

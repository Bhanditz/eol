Greetings, <%= @user.full_name %>.

You have some notifications arriving because you asked for them to be delievered "immediately".  We're currently
working on this code, so this isn't terribly helpful, but at least you can get some idea of how often you'll get
email.  Heh.

<%- @notes.each do |note| -%>
  <%- if note.respond_to?(:body) -%>
You got a comment from <%= note.user.full_name %>:

    <%= note.body %>
  <%- elsif note.is_a?(CommunityActivityLog) -%>
    <%- if note.activity_id == Activity.join.id -%>
    The user <%= note.user.full_name %> joined the community <%= note.community.name %>.
    <%- elsif note.activity_id == Activity.leave.id -%>
    The user <%= note.user.full_name %> left the community <%= note.community.name %>.
    <%- elsif note.activity_id == Activity.add_manager.id -%>
    The user <%= note.user.full_name %> made <%= note.member.user.full_name %> a manager of the community <%= note.community.name -%>.
    <%- else -%>
    Someone did something to the <%= note.community.name %> community. It might have been a <%= note.activity.name %>
    <%- end -%>
  <%- elsif note.is_a?(CuratorActivityLog) -%>
    <% if note.data_object %>
    <%= note.user.full_name %> performed a <%= note.activity.name %> action on <%= note.data_object.best_title %>
    (<%= note.data_object.data_type.label %> #<%= note.data_object.id %>)
    <% elsif note.taxon_concept %>
    <%= note.user.full_name %> performed a <%= note.activity.name %> action on <%= note.taxon_concept.title %>
    (pages/<%= note.taxon_concept.id %>)
    <% end %>
  <%- else -%>
    You got something else.  It was a <%= note.class.name %>, but I can't handle those yet.
  <%- end %>

<%- end -%>
Thanks.  Have fun.

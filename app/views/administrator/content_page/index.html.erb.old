  	  <li>You should be comfortable with HTML before editing. Do not use unusual fonts or styles when editing or creating pages - use simple HTML and see current pages for examples.</li>
      <li>You can reference images with the HTML &lt;img&gt; tag, but they must exist at a URL already, such as from the originating website or a site such as Flickr.  There is no facility to upload images or other files for use directly in the pages.</li>
  	  <li>Pages/items created in the "About EOL", "Press Room", "Using the Site" and "Feedback" sections will have links to them automatically created in the top navigation.</li>
  	  <li>Pages/items created in the "Footer" section will have links to them automatically created in the footer.</li>
  	  <li>Pages created in the "Other" section will not be added to any navigational menus -- you must link to these pages manually.</li>
  	  <li>Changes are made immediately after submitting the form - be sure to use the preview button before publishing!   Due to caching it may take up to an hour for changes to be seen for all users.</li>
      <li>If you make a mistake, use the "Archived Versions" drop-down menu to retrieve the previous version of the page.  You can then preview and publish to revert to the previous version.</li>
      <li>If you need to upload an image or a PDF to reference in the page, use the <%=link_to 'upload content',:controller=>'administrator/content_upload',:action=>'index'%> feature first, and then reference the file once it is uploaded.</li>

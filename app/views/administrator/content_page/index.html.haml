      You should be comfortable with HTML before editing. Do not use unusual fonts or styles when editing or creating pages - use simple HTML and see current pages for examples.
    %li
      You can reference images with the HTML &lt;img&gt; tag, but they must exist at a URL already, such as from the originating website or a site such as Flickr.  There is no facility to upload images or other files for use directly in the pages.
    %li
      Pages/items created in the "About EOL", "Press Room", "Using the Site" and "Feedback" sections will have links to them automatically created in the top navigation.
    %li
      Pages/items created in the "Footer" section will have links to them automatically created in the footer.
    %li
      Pages created in the "Other" section will not be added to any navigational menus -- you must link to these pages manually.
    %li
      Changes are made immediately after submitting the form - be sure to use the preview button before publishing!   Due to caching it may take up to an hour for changes to be seen for all users.
    %li
      If you make a mistake, use the "Archived Versions" drop-down menu to retrieve the previous version of the page.  You can then preview and publish to revert to the previous version.
    %li
      If you need to upload an image or a PDF to reference in the page, use the
      = link_to 'upload content',:controller=>'administrator/content_upload',:action=>'index'
      feature first, and then reference the file once it is uploaded.

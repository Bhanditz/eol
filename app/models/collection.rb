  # TODO = you can have collections that point to collections, so there SHOULD be a has_many relationship here to all of the
  # collection items that contain this collection.  ...I don't know if we need that yet, but it would normally be named
  # "collection_items", which doesn't work (because we're using that for THIS collection's children)... so we will have to
  # re-name it and make it slightly clever.

  validates_presence_of :name

  # This is cheating, slightly.  We want it to be unique within a user's scope, but ALSO within the scope of ALL
  # communities... it so happens that the scope of the later is, in fact, a user_id (of nil)... so this works:
  validates_uniqueness_of :name, :scope => [:user_id]
  validates_uniqueness_of :community_id, :if => Proc.new {|l| ! l.community_id.blank? }

Legs are pale red brown and femora are mottled with white flecks. The dorsal surface of the abdomen has paired brown areas separated by whitish lines. Palp: The palpal tibia has a long, pointed retrolateral apophysis and with a rounded ventral apophysis. The embolus is long and&nbsp;slender. The tegulum has two large apohyses; the distal apophysis has a large, rounded heel and the long, broad basal apophysis extends to the margin of the cymbium. Female: General structure and colour much like the male except she is paler. Epigynum: atrium broader toward anterior region and has a small shelf. The copulatory tubes are joined at their midline and the spermathecae are not convoluted.						0	0	0	0000-00-00 00:00:00	2006-12-23 16:12:00	2008-10-03 15:51:15	0000-00-00 00:00:00	0	0	2
